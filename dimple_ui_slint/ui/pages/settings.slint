/**
    - language: Will used to narrow wikidata queries, select bios, and for i18n.
    - libraries: List of the enabled libraries. I guess this should really be a
      plugin system but we'll get there later. For now it's ReferenceMachine.
      These will likely include auth flows.
    - import/export: still not sure about mp3 import or mp3 library, but still
      things like csv or json. I want to import my history and I don't see
      a reason for those to be libraries. 
    - cache stats, clear, relocate, etc.
