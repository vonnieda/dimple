# Dimple

A cross-platform, desktop music player that celebrates music, and privacy.

- Private. Gives you control of your music and listening data. All
  processing and recommendations are computed locally. Your data stays put.

- Smart. Uses your listening data to recommend artists, albums, genres, moods,
  and more.

- Simple. Focused on finding and playing music. Dimple helps you explore and
  discover your music libraries so that you can always find the right thing.

- Fast. Written in Rust, threaded to the gills, and GPU accelerated
  with egui. Scroll through thousands of albums at 60 FPS with beautiful
  artwork. Search thousands of tracks in milliseconds.

- Beautiful. A UI that celebrates the art and beauty of music. Artwork forward,
  and out of the way.

I wrote this because I love music, and I love listening to music. I wrote this
to empower music listeners. Explore, discover, and enjoy music on your terms.
