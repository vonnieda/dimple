private, and cross-platform. With Dimple you can listen to your music and
playlists on every supported device, follow favorite artists, discover new

## "Smart"

*Ed: explain the feature, drop the silly names.*

- "Deep Scrobbling" keeps track of your volume adjustments, repeats, skips,
  scrubs, likes, dislikes, and dozens of other interactive data points. This
  powers features like Current Obsessions, Mood Radio, AI DJ, ReplayGain,
  Instant Mixes, and more.
- Instant Mixes are infinite playlists based on Artists, Albums, Tracks,
  Genres, Playlists, and more. Everything is clickable and everything can
  start an Instant Mix.
- AI DJ uses text to speech and a small, fine-tuned AI brain to give you your
  own personal DJ. It announces songs and mixes, and adjusts to your
  reactions.
- Current Obsessions lets you jump right back into your recent favorites.
- Mood Radio instantly matches your mood with an infinite playlist of whatever
  you're feeling right now.
- ReplayGain automatically adjusts audio volume based on community feedback
  and your own adjustments.
- Sing Along shows and syncs the lyrics of whatever music is playing around
  you. Share your screen with your friends and sing along!

## Modern and Beautiful
- Based on Google's Material Design, with customizable themes.
- Artwork forward with abstract generated defaults when none is available.
- Responsive on any screen size.
- Light and Dark Mode, optionally follows your OS choice.
- Interactive waveform scrubbers let you "see" the music.

# Notes
- I'm writing Dimple as a way to learn Rust. If you see weird things in the code
  it's probably because I didn't know a better way. Please feel free to
  open a PR or Issue and let me know! I'm still learning, and I appreciate the
  help!
