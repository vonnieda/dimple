Dump new things at the bottom, move things to the top to prioritize.

- list sorting.
- track detail musicbrainz info, first pass.
- tantivy search
- change player bar to use player.on_change
- figure out how I'm going to implement queueing controls on table rows
- show currently playing track as playing in queue
- bug: music skips when switching from the Dimple window to another app, maybe other times too.
